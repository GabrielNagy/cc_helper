# cc_helper
wrapper for Cinema City's abysmal reservation UI

## What it does
* crawls event data from CinemaCity's API
* puts it through a blender that extracts the good bits (CouchDB)
* then basically prints them out (Flask)

## Features
* you can open the reservation pages in a NEW TAB (WOW)
* if you don't find nice seats, you can CLOSE the TAB and OPEN a NEW TAB at a different hour
* you don't have to select the cinema every time you open the website
* avoid loading unimportant data
